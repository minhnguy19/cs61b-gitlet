# Gitlet 

A project for Data Structures and Algorithms (CS61B), UC Berkeley's second introductory computer science course.

- Developed a version control system that mimics basic features of Git and implemented 15+ of Git functions.
- Built an efficient process to create, update, and remove files that worked seamlessly with the OS.
- Managed persistence by assigning a serialized SHA-1 hash Id for changes in the commit tree.
- Implemented merge-branch via utilizing BFS to find the shortest distance to the branchesâ€™ split point.
- Wrote design documents and extensive amount of unit, integration, and acceptance tests.
